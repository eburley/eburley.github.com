title: Finally a carrier has a real BYOD plan.
excerpt: As mentioned in a previous [article](/2013/05/05/free-phone-timesuck.html), finding an MVNO that understands BYOD was a pain in the backend.  Finally T-Mobile brought a plan that made sense.

As mentioned in a previous [article](/2013/05/05/free-phone-timesuck.html), finding an MVNO
that understands BYOD was a pain in the backend.  Finally T-Mobile brought a plan that made sense.

After many years in the Arizona and iOS ecosystems, my family and I have moved to Southern California,
and I've started working at a [company](http://www.google.com) that does some really
neat things on Android devices. (My opinions are my own, and not that of my
employer).  They do some pretty great apps on iOS as well, but I wanted to try
the phones that my friends and coworkers have been raving about.  In addition,
our old carrier didn't have a good signal (1 bar or less).

So we ordered two unlocked android phones (a nexus 5, and a moto x), and signed up for T-mobile's 
simple family plan, where if you're bringing your own device you don't pay a
subsidy.  Doing the math on the two carrier's plans and bringing your own
device, You'll break even versus a shared data plan with a phone subsidy in 5
months.  Over a two year period you'll save about 1,040 dollars.  Of course
YMMV, and this is just my opinion.  ATT looks to have a BYOD plan as well at
this point.
